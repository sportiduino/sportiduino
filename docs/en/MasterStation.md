# Master station

The Master station can be made in various boxes.

The circuit and board are available in Upverter ([variant 1](https://upverter.com/AlexanderVolikov/3fc0efdb2586988d/Sportiduino-reading-stantion/) or [variant 2](https://upverter.com/design/syakimov/4f7ec0e2d3b9c4e9/sportiduino-master-station/)).

All components of the circuit can be placed on a PCB or soldered to the Arduino by a ordinary wires.
The electronics of the master station can be placed in the Gainta G1020BF box or in a specially designed box that can be printed on a 3D printer.
[More about the assembly](MasterStationAssembly.md).

The station is connected to the computer using a USB port.
The Arduino Nano already has a built-in Serial-to-USB converter, so no additional converters are needed.
The station will be displayed in the connected devices as a COM port or /dev/ttyUSBx in Linux.

### Serial data protocol

The transmission of information between PC and Master Station occurs sequentially by sending up to 32-byte packets.

| | Value | Byte address in the packet |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Start | 0xFE | 0 |
| Function | | 1 |
| The length of the data or packet number + 0x1E | | 2 |
| Data array | | 3..x (x<31) |
| Checksum | x+1 |

The packet starts with byte 0xFE.

The command is specified by the byte with address 1.
Then in byte 2 the data length follows, if the transmitted packet is the last packet or its number + 30, if multipacket transmission is in progress.

Next comes an array of transmitted data up to 28 bytes.

At the end of the packet contains a checksum: the remainder of dividing by 256 the sum of bytes 1..x.
Commands pass only with the correct value of the checksum and start byte.

### SPORTident emulation

Firmware of Master station v1.8.0 or greater has support of reading card by the SPORTident data transfer protocol.
All RFID tags are read as SI-Card (192 punch mode).
Communication tested with SPORTident Reader, Rogain Manager, SportOrg, MeOS 3.8.1277 and WinOrient 2.0a (2014 - 2020) software.
