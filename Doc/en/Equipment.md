To upload boatloder, you will additionally need another Arduino, it is convenient to take arduino UNO.

To upload the firmware you need USB-UART (USB-TTL, USB-SERIAL, etc.). I'm using the scheme CH340. It is important that the DTR pin (RST) is working, read the reviews before purchasing.

To connect the boards to each other you need wires, for example Dupont
